        <p>
          I'm currently working hard to become a freelance engineer.<br />
          I'm passionate about learning programming languages and tools,<br />
          especially in both front-end and back-end development.<br />
          I love building things that are both beautiful and functional.<br />
          I'm always excited to take on new challenges and improve my skills!
