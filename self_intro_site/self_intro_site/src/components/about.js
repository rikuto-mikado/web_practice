        <p>
        Hi, I'm currently working hard to become a freelance engineer.
        I'm passionate about learning various programming languages and tools, and I strive to grow every day.
        I'm especially interested in both front-end and back-end development, and
        I love building things that are both beautiful and functional.
        I'm always excited to take on new challenges and improve my skills!
