# Classic CafÃ© Website
A responsive demo website for a fictional cafÃ©.
Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and designed for both desktop and mobile users.

## ðŸ“¸ Features
Split layout:
Left side = changing images (on PC)
Right side = menu navigation ("View Menu", "Contact Us")

## Mobile Responsive:
On small screens, background images change automatically and buttons are stacked vertically.

## Menu section:
Simple menu items with responsive grid layout.

## Contact form:
Dummy form (for design only, no real submission).

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
Next.js
Tailwind CSS
React (Hooks: useState, useEffect)
Formspree (dummy setup)

## ðŸ“– Notes
The "Contact" form is non-functional:
It uses onSubmit={(e) => e.preventDefault()} to prevent actual submission.
Background images rotate automatically every 5 seconds.
Fully responsive layout (adjusts perfectly across devices).
